Questions:

Variable declaration:
    Default as to size 4?
    Default val to 0?
    What to do with signed?

Unarymath:
    Can't tell how DEC works? Does it only work an accumulator?
    LOGNOT no idea
    ADDRESSOF and CONTENTOF not sure what to put here

Binarymath:
    DIV and MOD notimplemented yet?
    Not sure how shifts + Rotates should be implemented 
        Our langspec has 3 vars, our macro only uses 2
            Im trying to repeat the number of shifts based on third input var? Not sure if this is right or works
        Not sure how to do right shifts or rots at all  
    Not sure how ALSO or EITHER should be implemented
    
Assignment:
    How to assign a non variable to a variable?
        What i currently have in here i dont think works at all    

Functions:
    How do?
    Currently functions must go at bottom of file
    Properties:
        Deciding to make is so order must be RETURNS follwed by TAKES if RETURN exists
        So can be   FUNCTION 
                    FUNCTION RETURNS ...
                    FUNCTION TAKES ... , ...
                    FUNCTION RETURNS ... TAKES ... , ...
        Also using order number instead of name for params for now            
                
                
    nameLabel:
    datalabels
    jmp nameReturnLabel
    
    Calls:
        Not sure how to do returns - atm a function leaves a return label at call but this would mean can only be used once?
Files:
    How do?
   

General questions:
    Data sections/isntruction section? Does it need to be split up?


We currently have no way to declare strings in langspec - i guess we can use let var be version?
    How to differentiate between ascii and asciiz values?, what size to declare?
    How to auto size? Len of string * 8?
    
    
Notes:
    Load 0 before unconditional jumps
    
    
Inclusion:
INCLUDE "FILE.CB"
FUNCTION MOV16 RETURNS 4 TAKES 4
    ASM MOV16 MOV16_0 INTO MOV16_RET
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION MUL
    OP1 = 0
    OP2 BE PARAM1
    ASM LOD N_[0]
    OP1EX BE 0
    ASM STR OP2EX
    
    
ASM FUNC 
    
    
FILE IO will be on bus and driver levels



TOOl chain error: Both a size and a value must be declared for a .data element on line -
    macro: .data 2
Not sure where this is being added, must be between naomi and ryans code
